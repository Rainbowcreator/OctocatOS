OctocatOS: Embarking on a New Journey of Operating Systems
 
# 1. Introduction
 
Dear technology enthusiasts and friends in the open - source community:
 
Hello! Today, I am honored to introduce you to a uniquely crafted homemade operating system - OctocatOS. It embodies the dreams and efforts of numerous developers. From the initial spark of inspiration to the gradual construction of a complete technical architecture, every stage witnesses the boundless enthusiasm and spirit of exploration in the field of operating systems.
 
As an individual developer, Rainbowcreator, I am excited to share this project with you all on the open - source community GitHub.
 
# 2. Outstanding Features of OctocatOS
 

## 2.1 High - efficiency Kernel, Lightning - fast Experience

# 3. The Transformation of Pricing Strategy
 
## 3.1 Initial Pricing Considerations
 
Initially, we planned to sell OctocatOS at a price of 983 yuan RMB / US dollars. This price was not set arbitrarily. It was determined through comprehensive consideration of various factors such as the cost investment in the development process, the technical value, and market research. It represents the countless days and nights of hard work by the development team and the huge cost invested in technology research and development.
 
## 3.2 Moving towards Open - source and Free
 
However, after in - depth discussions within the team and a deeper understanding of the open - source spirit, we have decided to make a significant change: starting from 11:53 on February 16, 2025, OctocatOS will be completely free and open - sourced on various technology communities. We firmly believe that open - sourcing can bring together the wisdom of developers around the world, enabling OctocatOS to continuously evolve and become more perfect and powerful under the joint efforts of everyone.
 
# 4. Continuous Updates and Listening to Feedback
 
We promise to continuously add new patches to OctocatOS and keep updating and optimizing it. This is not only to fix potential problems but also to keep up with the trend of technological development and bring users an even better experience. At the same time, we sincerely hope that users will provide us with more feedback during the use of the operating system. Every suggestion from you is extremely valuable to us. The development team will carefully collect and deeply study them, so that OctocatOS can grow into an operating system that better meets users' needs with the joint attention and support of everyone.
 
# 5. Open - source Initiative, Working Hand in Hand
 
We look forward to working hand in hand with developers around the world to contribute to the development of OctocatOS. Through open - sourcing, we hope to build a vibrant and creative community where everyone can share ideas, exchange experiences, and make progress together.
