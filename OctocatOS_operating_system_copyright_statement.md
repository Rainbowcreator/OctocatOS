# Copyright Notice for OctocatOS
 
# 1. Copyright Ownership
 
The copyright of the OctocatOS operating system and all its components, including relevant code, documentation, graphical interface design, and attached software tools (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "OctocatOS Project"), belongs to the individual developer Rainbowcreator. Without explicit written permission, no individual, organization, or entity shall arbitrarily copy, modify, distribute, disseminate, display, execute, or create derivative works based on the OctocatOS Project.
 
Although OctocatOS has been open - sourced and is free for public use on the GitHub open - source community, this does not mean the waiver of copyright. Open - sourcing is a way of authorized use under the open - source agreement, aiming to promote the sharing and development of technology. All users must abide by the relevant open - source agreement and the provisions of this copyright notice.
 
# 2. Provisions of the Open - Source Agreement
 
OctocatOS follows the [MIT LICENSE] open - source agreement. According to this agreement, users have the right to:
 
- Freely use OctocatOS for personal learning, research, and internal business applications, but they need to retain all copyright notices and license statements in the OctocatOS Project.
 
- Modify and redistribute OctocatOS under the premise of complying with the open - source agreement. The modified version must clearly indicate the modified content and the information of the modifier, and the original open - source agreement text must be attached when distributing.
 
Users are prohibited from:
 
- Using the OctocatOS Project for any illegal, harmful, infringing, or unethical activities.
 
- Attempting to remove, tamper with, or conceal the copyright notices, license statements, and other relevant markings in the OctocatOS Project. Otherwise, they will bear corresponding legal responsibilities.
 
- Conducting reverse engineering, decompiling, or disassembling OctocatOS, unless explicitly permitted by law.
 
# 3. Disclaimer of Liability
 
Rainbowcreator provides OctocatOS "as is" and does not provide any express or implied warranties of any kind, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non - infringement. In no event shall Rainbowcreator be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including but not limited to procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) arising out of the use of or inability to use OctocatOS, regardless of the cause and theory of liability (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise), even if Rainbowcreator has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 
Since OctocatOS is open - source software, users may modify and customize it based on their own needs. Rainbowcreator does not assume any warranty liability for the modified versions by users, and any problems and risks arising therefrom shall be borne by the users themselves.
 
# 4. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
 
Given that OctocatOS is released globally, the interpretation and enforcement of this copyright notice, as well as any disputes related to OctocatOS, shall be primarily governed by English law. English law has a well - established legal system, independent judiciary, and wide recognition in the international business field, which can provide a stable legal framework for the use, distribution, and protection of rights related to OctocatOS. Meanwhile, the terms of the MIT LICENSE under which OctocatOS is open - sourced will be an important reference in the application of law, jointly governing the use and related behaviors of OctocatOS with English law provisions.
 
Additionally, the provisions of the World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty (WCT) also influence the domestic laws of its member states to a certain extent regarding software copyright protection. Although the specific applicable law is English law, the principles and spirit of the WCT can help coordinate legal differences among different countries and reduce potential legal conflicts. When dealing with disputes related to the copyright of OctocatOS, the relevant content of the WCT will also be comprehensively considered.
 
If any disputes arise regarding the copyright of OctocatOS or this notice, the two parties shall first resolve them through friendly consultations. If the consultations fail, either party has the right to file a lawsuit with the English court having jurisdiction.
